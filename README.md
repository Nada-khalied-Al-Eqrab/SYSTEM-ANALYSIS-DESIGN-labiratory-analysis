# Laboratory Analysis System - System Analysis and Design

This project focuses on the analysis and design of a system for a laboratory analysis. The goal is to create a system that can manage all aspects of laboratory analysis operations, from receiving samples to issuing results.

## Project Overview

The laboratory analysis system will manage multiple aspects of operations, including:

*   **Patient Management:** Register patient information, track their medical history, and manage their visits.
*   **Sample Management:** Receive samples, register them, track them, and manage their storage.
*   **Analysis Execution:** Manage types of analyses, record results, and validate them.
*   **Report Generation:** Generate accurate and reliable medical reports, and distribute them to patients and doctors.
*   **Inventory Management:** Track inventory of chemicals and tools used in analyses, and manage suppliers.
*   **Equipment Management:** Track maintenance and repair of equipment used in analyses.
*   **Employee Management:** Manage employee information and assign tasks.

## System Architecture

The system architecture will consist of the following components:

*   **User Interface:** A user-friendly graphical interface for employees, doctors, and patients.
*   **Database:** Stores all system data, including patient information, samples, analyses, and employees.
*   **Patient Management Module:** Manages all aspects of patient information, from registration to tracking their medical history.
*   **Sample Management Module:** Receives samples, registers them, tracks them, and manages their storage.
*   **Analysis Execution Module:** Manages types of analyses, records results, and validates them.
*   **Report Generation Module:** Generates accurate and reliable medical reports and distributes them.
*   **Inventory Management Module:** Tracks inventory of chemicals and tools and manages suppliers.
*   **Equipment Management Module:** Tracks maintenance and repair of equipment.
*   **Employee Management Module:** Manages employee information and assigns tasks.

## Diagrams

The following diagrams will be created as part of the system analysis and design process:

*   **Context Diagram (Three Levels):**
    *   Level 0: Shows the system as a whole and the interactions with external entities, such as patients, doctors, and suppliers.
    *   Level 1: Shows the major processes within the system, such as patient management, sample management, and analysis execution.
    *   Level 2: Provides more details about the sub-processes within each major process.
*   **Database Diagram:** Illustrates the structure of the database, including tables and the relationships between them.
*   **Other Diagrams:** Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams.

## Project Status

*   **Analysis Phase:** Completed
*   **Design Phase:** In progress
*   **Development Phase:** Not started
*   **Testing Phase:** Not started
*   **Deployment Phase:** Not started

## Conclusion

This project represents an ambitious effort to develop a comprehensive system for managing a laboratory analysis. By leveraging the latest technologies and following best practices in systems analysis and design, we aim to create a system that effectively meets the needs of users and contributes to improving the efficiency of operations in laboratory analyses.
